# MuseumLangAPI-Language-Detection-for-Museums
MuseumLangID evolves into **MuseumLangAPI**: a REST service that exposes the model for automatic language detection of museum texts.   The API receives texts in JSON format, returns the detected language code along with a confidence score, and is designed to scale and integrate seamlessly with the museum’s management systems.
